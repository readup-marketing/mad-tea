            <div class="story-text">
                <p>"Clean cup! Move along!" the Hatter and March Hare suddenly shouted together. They all moved one place around the table.</p>

                <p>Alice was confused by this odd command, but she moved to a new seat anyway. The Dormouse woke up and sat down where Alice had been sitting.</p>

                <p>"Now we can have some fun!" thought Alice. "Maybe they'll ask me a riddle I can actually answer."</p>

                <p>But instead, the March Hare said to the Dormouse, "Tell us a story!"</p>

                <p>"Yes, please do!" said Alice.</p>

                <p>"And be quick about it," added the Hatter, "or you'll be asleep again before you finish."</p>

                <p>"Once upon a time there were three little sisters," the Dormouse began hurriedly, "and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie. They lived at the bottom of a well‚Äî"</p>

                <p>"What did they eat?" said Alice, who always wanted to know about food and drink.</p>

                <p>"They lived on treacle," said the Dormouse, after thinking for a moment.</p>

                <p>"They couldn't have done that," Alice said gently. "They would have become ill."</p>

                <p>"So they were," said the Dormouse, "very ill."</p>

                <p>Alice tried to imagine what such a strange life would be like, but it puzzled her too much. So she asked, "But why did they live at the bottom of a well?"</p>

                <p>"Have some more tea," the March Hare said to Alice very seriously.</p>

                <p>Alice had had quite enough of the mad tea party. She stood up and walked away. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and the other two didn't even notice her leaving, though she looked back once or twice hoping they might call after her.</p>

                <p>"That's the silliest tea party I ever went to in my whole life!" she said to herself as she walked through the wood.</p>

                <p>But even as she left, Alice couldn't help smiling at the memory of their peculiar logic and endless word games. Wonderland might be confusing, but it certainly was never boring.</p>
